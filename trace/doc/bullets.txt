Main Goals:
  * timing info  ( microsecond timeofday timestamp ) - to look for anomolies
    o  delta time between application specific points.
    o  real time (high speed/efficient) samples -- store every one (several
          thousand to maybe a few million). (basic stats)
       -  low performance impact
Other Goals
  * multiple application specific points at the same time
    - selectable (names,masks) -- min-to-no impact, (recompile -DNO_TRACE?)
  * multi-threaded (multiple buffers?)
  * system info - tid
  * system info - task switch, interrupts  -- module
  * application parameters  (avoid most "formatting")
  * configurable  - msgSz,numParams,numEntries,names
  * trigger
  * subset to stdout (console log)  - should this (default) to human readable?
      - correlate console log (error) output with high-speed details.
  * user "logger" function

Companion utility - trace_delta.pl
   delta time
   filter out time not between points


Trace vs. other utilities:

   The most basic trace example would, on the surface, look like something
   a profiling utility would do:
     sample points near the beginning and end of some function.
   -- profile the function: min max ave.
   But, maybe you really want only a sub part of the funtion (and it's unnatural
   to restructure the code).

   Yes, TRACE is _like_ "instrumenting" your code and this takes compiling it.
   But its also significantly different then instrumenting you code.
   The goal is that you would _not_ recompile after your done:
       - the instrumenting is only at (relatively, i.e. not every function call
         entry/exit) a few key/significant locations
       - tracing is low impact and masked of is much lower (near, but
         admittedly not zero).
       - some of the location you would want console output
       - (just) in case you want to enable and check trace details in the
         future.

   With parameters, you can easily filter... (i.e. function part only when
   parameter is within some range).

   Profiling will just give basic stats (and likely sparse sampling) vs.
      every sample for a particular (snapshot) timeperiod.

   What (else) was happening at a specific time...

Running "under" a profiler...
   Does a profile effect operation???
