Rework 5 in 1 -- it seems inconsistent, overly complex. Need to find the MiLC.

Init - thread vs. process -- should be able to do one mapping per process to
  get traceControl_p.  Since it takes time to do the mapping, there needs to be
  an InitLock which threads of the same process will use to determine whether or
  not they are the single thread which is doing the init or if it has to wait for
  another thread to complete the init.

module - add init check to allow for name-per-module???  maybe go back to compile time--
  where TRACE_NAME must be defined before include of trace.h???

develop test sweet - threads, 5-in-1, etc.


DONE:

make "show" more flexible:
   -- heading/no heading
   -- which fields get shown

go back to 1 mmap - ref nova dcm_kernel_module/dcm_data.c
  -- preliminary attempt failed

process msg string in "show"
   make sure last char is not '\n'
   convert %s,... to %p
   I think I should forget about "%m$" and "*m$"

a way to set a level mask (or lvl bit) on for all tids/names -- usefull for
setting all trigger masks for "trigger on anything"

libtrace.c -> libtrace.a, libtrace.so
