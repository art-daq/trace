The kernel can have a virtual file which can be mmapped. This
file would map to just memory and would not be associated with
any device.  Switching between this file and any user created
file is easy.  The problem with a userspace file (file on a device)
is that eventually the system will want to flush data to disk.
This is a way for the buffer to be saved/archived but this _may_
be an issue when flushes happen at inopportune times.
These are not issues when the kernel virutal file is used.
It is not recommended that the user file be on an NFS device (which is
often the case for home areas -- which is why the default trace_buffer
file is in /tmp)
Shared mem is just memory but it is harder to manage and I currently
don't know an easy way to get the kernel to create a shared memory region.
