go back to 1 mmap - ref nova dcm_kernel_module/dcm_data.c
  -- preliminary attempt failed

add -n<NAME> option to Trace_cntl to setenv("TRACENAME","<NAME>",1)

process msg string in "show"
   make sure last char is not '\n'
   convert %s,... to %p
   I think I should forget about "%m$" and "*m$"

libtrace.c -> libtrace.a, libtrace.so

rename struct member to indicate trigger _armed_:
    when activePost is non-zero --> "armed"
    when trigIdxCnt is set  --> triggered/"collecting post trigger samples"
    triggerComplete (when post# complete and mode has been turned offf)

a way to set a level mask (or lvl bit) on for all tids/names -- usefull for
setting all trigger masks for "trigger on anything"
