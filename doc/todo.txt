clean up documentation since move from cvs.

TRACE_LVLM???

module - add init check to allow for name-per-module???  maybe go back to compile time--
  where TRACE_NAME must be defined before include of trace.h???

develop test sweet - threads, 5-in-1, etc.

%u %U on TRACE_FILE for "user" (/tmp/trace_buffer_%u) "uid" (/run/user/%U/trace_buffer)

signal handler - trace_cntl - ignore signal when trace_lock

DONE:

make "show" more flexible:
   -- heading/no heading
   -- which fields get shown

go back to 1 mmap - ref nova dcm_kernel_module/dcm_data.c
  -- preliminary attempt failed

process msg string in "show"
   make sure last char is not '\n'
   convert %s,... to %p
   I think I should forget about "%m$" and "*m$"

a way to set a level mask (or lvl bit) on for all tids/names -- usefull for
setting all trigger masks for "trigger on anything"

libtrace.c -> libtrace.a, libtrace.so
