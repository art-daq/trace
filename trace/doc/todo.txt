make "show" more flexible:
   -- heading/no heading
   -- which fields get shown

go back to 1 mmap - ref nova dcm_kernel_module/dcm_data.c
  -- preliminary attempt failed

process msg string in "show"
   make sure last char is not '\n'
   convert %s,... to %p
   I think I should forget about "%m$" and "*m$"

libtrace.c -> libtrace.a, libtrace.so

a way to set a level mask (or lvl bit) on for all tids/names -- usefull for
setting all trigger masks for "trigger on anything"
