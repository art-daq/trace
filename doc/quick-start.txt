Quick start for TRACE (version 3):

    - get the SW and cd to it.
    - make OUT=$PWD    # this should create 1 or 2 Linux*/bin directories
    - export TRACE_NAME=TRACE
    - Linux+*/bin/trace_cntl test
    - Linux+*/bin/trace_cntl show

After that, just poke around and ... ?have fun? :)
Look at the source under src_example/.

If you want TRACE to behave like printf, make sure TRACE_LVLS=-1 is in
your environment.

   export TRACE_LVLS=-1

If you want TRACE to create the standard file (/tmp/trace_buffer_$USER), it is
recommended that you put TRACE_NAME=TRACE, TRACE_MSGMAX=0 or TRACE_ARGSMAX=10
in your environment. TRACE_MSGMAX=0 will give default of 128.


NOTE: if there are no TRACE_* variables defined in the environment, TRACE
will basically be disabled.


See the doc/users_guide.txt file for further details.
